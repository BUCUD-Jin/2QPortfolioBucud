    <title>All About Our Favorite Minecraft Structures</title>
    <h1> ANCIENT CITY </h1>
    <p> The Ancient City is one of our favorite structures since it provides overpowered loot. However, traversing through this structure is really challenging since the Warden, one of the most difficult mobs to deal with, might spawn.</p>

    <h1> All About the Ancient City </h1>
    <p> The Ancient City is a very large structure that spawns within a Deep Dark Biome. The City contains long corridors with 2-block-deep layers of gray wool on the floor, and some rugs made of blue, light blue and cyan wool or carpet floors. There are some small ruins in the city with chest that contain very good loot. </p>
    <h1> The Warden </h1> </div>
    <p> As stated earlier, this structure is the home of the Warden. <div> </div> 
        The Warden spawns if it hears noise made by the player. To prevent this from happening, crouch at all times while navigating through the city. If you accidentally spawned the Warden, stay calm and keep crouching. <div> </div>
        The Warden is blind but has a very good sense of sound. Any type of noice, including the player's footsteps will attract the Warden. Since this city is the home of the Warden, there is a large frame that can be found in the center of the city that resemble the Warden. </p>
